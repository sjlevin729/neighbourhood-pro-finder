I have hired a number of cleaners over the past 3 years that have been disappointing so was a little apprehensive but can honestly say Georgia, Kayleigh and the team are the best I have ever used. I have since requested to utilise them to clean my home on a regular basis to keep on top of the fantastic job they have done cleaning my home. Thank you so much! Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed! \\ud83c\\udf1f\\ud83c\\udf1f\\ud83c\\udf1f\\ud83c\\udf1f\\ud83c\\udf1f", "rating": 5, "date": "3 months ago"}]'},
